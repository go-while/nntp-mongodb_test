# MongoDBTest - MongoDB Usenet Article Storage Test

`mongodbtest` is a Go program that tests article insertion, retrieval, and deletion in a MongoDB database for NNTP servers.

It utilizes the nntp-mongodb-storage package to handle storage operations and provides various test cases to evaluate different aspects of the MongoDB storage.


# Test Prerequisites
Before running the mongodbtest.go script, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

Go Programming Language: Install Go from the official website (https://golang.org/dl/) and set up your Go environment.

MongoDB: Ensure you have a running MongoDB server accessible at the specified URI (MongoURI).

The MongoDB connection URI should include the necessary authentication details and the address of the MongoDB server.


## Test Installation

You can clone this repository and build the test program using the following commands:

```shell
# go get github.com/go-while/nntp-mongodb-storage
# git clone https://github.com/go-while/nntp-mongodb_test
cd nntp-mongodb_test
go build -o mongodbtest mongodbtest.go

```

# Test Usage

To run the test program, execute the compiled binary:

```shell
./mongodbtest # runs all defined 'testCases' in mongodbtest.go
```

# Test Cases
The test program supports the following test cases:
 - "read": Tests article retrieval from the MongoDB collection based on the given MessageIDHash.
 - "delete": Tests article deletion from the MongoDB collection based on the given MessageIDHash.
 - "no-compression": Inserts articles without any compression.
 - "gzip": Inserts articles with gzip compression.
 - "zlib": Inserts articles with zlib compression.
 - Set the number of test iterations using the -test-num flag.
```shell
./mongodbtest -test-case=<test-case> -test-num=<num>
```

The test program will perform the following steps:
```
1. Load MongoDB storage with the default configurations.
2. Iterate over the specified number of inserts (default: 5000000).
3. For each insert, generate an example article with a unique MessageID and MessageIDHash.
4. Perform different actions based on the specified test case:
   - "read": Read existing articles with the given MessageIDHash.
   - "delete": Delete existing articles with the given MessageIDHash.
   - "no-compression": Insert articles without any compression.
   - "gzip": Insert articles with gzip compression.
   - "zlib": Insert articles with zlib compression.

5. Log details for each step, including the raw size of the article, the size after compression (if applicable), whether the article was inserted or read successfully, and the content of the article when the "read" test case is chosen.
```



# ChatGPT Review Logical Considerations

Upon reviewing the code, I have identified a few potential logical issues or considerations:

The code has the following logical considerations and potential issues:

Command-Line Flag Validation: The code checks if the specified test case is a supported test case but lacks handling for invalid or unsupported test cases.

Error Handling: Detailed error handling is lacking for various operations, such as compression/decompression errors or MongoDB-related errors.

Time Delays: Time delays introduced using time.Sleep may not be optimally set for background operations.

Hash Collisions: The code generates SHA256 hashes of message IDs, but it does not explicitly handle potential hash collisions.


# Disclaimer

Please note that this test program and the module [https://github.com/go-while/nntp-mongodb-storage](https://github.com/go-while/nntp-mongodb-storage) were mostly generated by an AI language model (OpenAI's GPT-3.5, based on GPT-3) for demonstration purposes.

While efforts have been made to ensure its correctness, it is always recommended to review and validate the code before using it in production environments.
